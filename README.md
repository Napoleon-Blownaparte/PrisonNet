# Welcome to the PrisonNet page

## Introduction

PrisonNet is a server core built for prison servers, intended to be highly configurable, packed with features yet compact. This page will run you through the features of PrisonNet, how to configure them correctly and even some templates to get you started. This plugin comes pre-configured, so if you wish, you can simply change the prefix and be done with it - however, the options are limitless.

## Dependencies

To use this plugin, you will need to install the latest version of **Vault** for Spigot 1.16.5, in order to make the most of economy features. There are built-in economy commands, however you may use whichever plugin you wish to manage that.

## Data Storage

This part is quite important, because when you first install the plugin, you'll be greeted with a choice - YML or MySQL. If you do not have a MySQL database, then you must use YML to store any player data. SQL is suitable if you wish to access said data from third party applications, such as websites. YML is suitable if you wish to have a quicker, more manageable, means of storing your data.

**If you select SQL you must provide valid credentials, otherwise no players will be able to connect to the server, in order to prevent errors.**

## Installation

Setting up PrisonNet is fairly straightforward, just follow these steps:

1. Place 'PrisonNet.jar' into your server's plugins folder,
2. Restart your server,
3. Start configuring the plugin from the "PrisonNet" folder!
